# NPM Compromise Detection Tool Requirements
# Python 3.7+ required

# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library:
# - json (for parsing package files and configuration)
# - os (for file system operations)
# - re (for regex pattern matching)
# - sys (for exit codes and arguments)
# - subprocess (for npm cache checking)
# - pathlib (for cross-platform path handling)
# - typing (for type hints)
# - argparse (for command line parsing)
# - datetime (for timestamps)

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features:
# colorama>=0.4.4  # For colored terminal output on Windows
# requests>=2.28.0  # For future URL validation features
# pyyaml>=6.0      # For YAML configuration support

# Development dependencies:
# pytest>=7.0.0    # For unit testing
# black>=22.0.0    # For code formatting
# flake8>=5.0.0    # For linting
# mypy>=0.991      # For type checking
